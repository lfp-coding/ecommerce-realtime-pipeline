# E-Commerce Real-Time Analytics Pipeline

A learning-focused, production-style data engineering project that simulates an e-commerce realtime pipeline: synthetic event generation, Kafka streaming, Postgres storage, basic monitoring, and a simple dashboard.

**Status:** Configuration & Testing Setup Complete

## Goals

- Generate realistic e-commerce events (customers, products, orders, events) in realtime
- Stream data via Kafka topics
- Persist and query data in Postgres
- Prepare transformations and analytics workflows
- Add basic monitoring and a lightweight dashboard
